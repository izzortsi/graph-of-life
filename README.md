What'd you expect? Of course this is about Conway's (Game of) Life!

## A topologically static version:

## Topology-dynamics interaction:

![and as well of Death, I guess](https://github.com/izzortsi/graph-of-life/blob/e6da112f015fbe24fad3d456093f838cba2b62de/frames/graph_life2.gif "and as well of Death, I guess")


## TODO

- Adding vertices and edges;
- Refactoring and improving performance;
- Finding known structures? Maybe a glider?
- Testing other dynamical rules;
- Testing other dynamics-topology interaction rules;
- Extending to a package that implements arbitrary "graphical automata".
